# personal-website

I set up a simple custom domain on [Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) and hosted the page on [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

It's quite simple frow now - just a static webpage configured with Django following their [official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) (I didn't need to go past part one)

Maybe I'll add to this as time goes on - but for now, it served as a good inital exercise to dip my toes into the world of Django
